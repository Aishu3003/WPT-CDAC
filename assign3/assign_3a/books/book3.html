              Part of O'Reilly's definitive set of Java documentation,
              <em>Learning Java</em> introduces the basics of Java, the
              object-oriented programming language for networked applications
              from Sun Microsystems. This book provides a broad survey of the
              Java 2 Standard Edition and contains everything necessary to get
              up to speed quickly. It covers the essentials of hot topics like
              Swing and JFC; describes new tools for signing applets and other
              Java classes; and shows how to write networked clients and
              servers, servlets, JavaBeans, and state-of-the-art user
              interfaces. Java started out as a tool for creating animated web
              pages, but it's proven to be much more. Java is now used for
              everything from sophisticated web clients to mission-critical
              enterprise applications. In the future, Java will become the basis
              for a new generation of distributed software that runs on devices
              ranging from cell phones to supercomputers. In the practical,
              hands-on approach characteristic of O'Reilly,
              <em>Learning Java</em>
              demonstrates why Java is now the language of choice for building
              the next generation of computer software. Includes a CD-ROM
              containing the example code and JBuilder for Windows and Solaris.
              <em>Learning Java</em> covers:
