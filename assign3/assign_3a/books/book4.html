              The <em>Java Cookbook</em> is a comprehensive collection of
              problems, solutions, and practical examples for anyone programming
              in Java. Developers will find hundreds of tried-and-true Java
              "recipes" covering all of the major APIs as well as some APIs that
              aren't as well documented in other Java books. The
              <em>Java Cookbook,</em> like the bestselling
              <em>Perl Cookbook,</em> covers a lot of ground, and offers Java
              developers short, focused pieces of code that can be easily
              incorporated into other programs. The idea is to focus on things
              that are useful, tricky, or both. The book includes code segments
              covering many specialized APIs--like media and servlets--and
              should serve as a great "jumping-off place" for Java developers
              who want to get started in areas outside of their specialization.
              The book provides quick solutions to particular problems that can
              be incorporated into other programs, but that aren't usually
              programs in and of themselves.
